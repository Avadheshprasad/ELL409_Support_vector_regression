# ELL409_Support_vector_regression
## Objective
To experiment with the use of SVMs for both binary and multiclass classification problems, and understand the
effects of varying various hyperparameters therein.

### Part1A
task is to try and learn an SVM classifier for these images using LIBSVM and CVX

### Part1B
task is to try and learn an SVM classifier for these images using simplified SMO

### Part1C
task is to try and learn an SVM classifier for these images using SMO
