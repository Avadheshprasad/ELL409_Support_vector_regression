# ELL409_Support_vector_regression
## Objective
To experiment with the use of SVMs for both binary and multiclass classification problems, and understand the
effects of varying various hyperparameters therein.

### Part1A
task is to try and learn an SVM classifier for these images using LIBSVM and CVX

### Part1B
task is to try and learn an SVM classifier for these images using simplified SMO

### Part1C
task is to try and learn an SVM classifier for these images using SMO

### Part 2 (1 unit, 4 marks)
 This data set has 8, 000 instances in the same type of 25-dimensional
feature space (compared to the 3, 000 instances in Part 1), and you are required to train a multiclass SVM model
for predicting the labels on a target set of 2, 000 instances (whose labels are hidden from you).
